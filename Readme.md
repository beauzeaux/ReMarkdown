# ReMarkdown

The ReMarkdown parser is a modular markdown parser supporting external plugins for additional element types beyond those
defined by John Gruber for the [original markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

# Installing
For basic use just use *bower*
```Shell
bower install
```

If you also want to run the intern test suite
```Shell
npm install
./node_modules/intern/bin/intern-client.js config=tests/intern.js
```

# Usage
Use at your own risk, this project is under heavy development. More through documentation
soon.
